dotcur
================================

dotcur is a small music game project aimed to be a cytus-like game aimed
for home desktops. so far the game works but it's lacking on features.

it's built using OpenGL/PortAudio and most if not all are freely licensed libraries.


building & dependencies
================================
so while the code itself is fairly simple it has quite an amount of dependencies

-boost 1.52
-CEGUI 0.78 // to be removed
-glew 1.90 // to be updated
-glfw 2.7.7
-portaudio v19, libogg and libvorbis
-glm 0.9.4.1

building is basically setting up the include and library directories to all these
libraries (for msvc v90) after compiling them for this toolset
and once that's done you open the main project and fire up your f7 key.

notes
================================
while right now it doesn't quite support linux (and I won't ever use "make" for my
own projects- ever) so far there are no system-specific dependencies so 
with some minor modifications it shouldn't be too much trouble to get it to compile.

there's some unfinished OpenGL 3.3 (Core profile) code in as well but using it
breaks CEGUI. There's two important macros to notice: DISABLE_CEGUI and OLD_GL
where the first disables cegui (while still needing the headers though)
and the second uses fixed-pipeline tutorial-level opengl code.

In the future I might do the backport of the modern shader stuff so i can use
the best of both worlds. not now though- since rendering works I'm more worried
about making it work at all than to pleasing graphics programmers.

now we use portaudio.

the format i created (BMS-like) is completely undocumented for now and I won't
document it until I finish the editor and a decent main menu interface.

that's all for now.
